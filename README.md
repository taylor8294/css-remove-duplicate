# CSS Remove Duplicate

A NodeJS script that will remove all redundant style declarations from a child CSS file, given a parent CSS file it inherits from. That is, removes all style declarations from the child that are already present in the parent file (and thus duplicated unnecessarily).

## Installation

Download and install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) on your machine if you have not already done so. Once installed, simply clone this repo locally and run `npm install`

```sh
git clone https://github.com/taylor8294/css-remove-duplicate.git
cd css-remove-duplicate
npm install
```

## Getting started

Try running `npm test` to check everything is working. You should see `Removed 47 of 60 CSS declarations (78%)` logged to the screen, followed by `See ./test/test.child.out.css`. If an error occurs, look into the error message to see why it failed.

## Usage

Make a folder in the root of the project, `css` say, and place the CSS files you wish to work with in there.

```sh
mkdir css
cp -p $(find /path/to/folder -type f -name "*.css") css
```

Make a copy of `example.config.json` named `config.json` and edit for your needs, feel free to remove any of the options from `config.json` to rely on the default instead.

```sh
cp example.config.json config.json
nano config.json
```

| Option | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `parentFile` | Path to single parent CSS file. | `"./parent.css"`
| `childFile` | Path to child CSS file -- can be a glob pattern to run the tool on multiple child files | `"./child.css"`
| `outputDir` | Folder where the resulting child files will be saved. | `"./out"`
| `outputFilename` | The filename used to save the resulting child CSS file in `outputDir`. Leave as `false` to use name of the input file -- must be `false` if `childFile` is a glob pattern or the output file will get overwritten each time. | `false`
| `outputFileExt` | Only if `outputFilename` is false, this replaces ".css" in the input file name with the given string | `".out.css"`
| `combineSelectors` | Whether CSS selectors with the same style declarations should be combined - setting to `false` effectively sets a maximum of one CSS selector per CSS rule (even if CSS selectors where combined in the input file) | `true`
| `removeComments` | By default all top-level comments in the child CSS file will remain in place regardless. All rule-level comments inside an at-rule (such as inside a `@media-query`) will remain in place as long as that at-rule is still present in the resulting child CSS file. Declaration-level comments will remain in place if the style declaration they immediately precede (or follow if the comment is at the end of a CSS rule) remains in the resulting CSS file, if not they are removed along with the declaration. Setting this option to `true` removes all comments, that is, the resulting CSS file will contain no comments at all. | `false`
| `commentsSameLine` | This is a formatting option, if set to `true` all comments immediately following a style declaration will be on the same line as that declaration, rather than the line below. However, it also has a functional purpose, if set to `true` and `removeComments` is false, declaration-level comments will remain in place if the style declaration they immediately *follow* (or *precede* if the comment is at the *start* of a CSS rule) remains in the resulting CSS file, as opposed to the other way round if this is `false` (see description of `removeComments` option) | `false`
| `removeEmptyLines` | This is a formatting option, if set to `true` all empty lines that were in the child CSS file will be removed, each style rule will be immediately follwed by the next. | `false`
| `verbose` | Verbose output | `false`
| `silent` | If `true` no output to the console (overridden by `verbose`) | `false`
| `logResult` | If true, the resulting child CSS is logged to the console before the script completes | `false`
| `returnString` | If true, the call the `CSSRemoveDuplicate` function returns the resulting CSS as a string rather than writing to an output file | `false`

Once the config is all setup you should just be able to run `npm start` to get your new reduce child CSS file.

You can also run `npm start -- -c /path/to/config.json` to specify the path to the config file on the command line (this is how `npm test` passes the `test.config.json` file).
